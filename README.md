# beetroot
Self-hosted infrastructure stack for families and small groups; local-first, container-based, and deeply rooted.

## Why beetroot?
Like its namesake, beetroot grows from the ground up. It’s unpolished, functional, educational, and unapologetically grows from fertile ground.

It’s for people who like knowing where their data lives, who prefer dirt under their nails to scripts they don’t understand.

Beets taste like dirt. beetroot tastes like control.
