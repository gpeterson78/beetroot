# beetroot
Self-hosted infrastructure stack for families and small groups; local-first, container-based, and deeply rooted.

## Why beetroot?
Beets taste like sugary dirt but I love them.  Like it's namesake Beetroot is unpolished, functional, healthy (educational), and unapologetically grows from the fertile ground sewn by all the amazing projects it's built upon.

It’s for people who like knowing where their data lives, who prefer dirt under their nails to scripts they don’t understand.

Beetroot tastes like control, I love that too.
